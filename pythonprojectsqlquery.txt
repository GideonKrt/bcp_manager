Create new employee records:
INSERT INTO 'table_name'(column_1,column_2,...) VALUES (value_1,value_2,...);

Delete employee records:
DELETE FROM 'table_name' WHERE EmployeeName='name_1';

SELECT * FROM 'table_name' WHERE EmployeeID=value_1;

SELECT * FROM 'table_name' WHERE OfficeLocation = 'Tampines';

SELECT * FROM 'table_name' WHERE WorkingHours = '0900 to 1800'

SELECT COUNT(EmployeeID) FROM 'table_name' WHERE OfficeLocation = 'Tampines' AND WorkingHours = '0900 to 1800'

need employee ID? isit easier?
should we create group name columns? so can select the groupname to show all records of employee in that grp easier?

Update employee records:
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
